    <p>The process was simple, I just started off by completely fooling around in brackets... Frankly, I had no idea what I was doing, but as I discovered more code , the possibilities because endless. You know what happens, when you put the power of HTML in MY hands? I make bunnies scroll across the screen as varying speeds. That's how the Bunny Races page evolved, but then I thought, what if there was MORE to this? With that, I made sure that every bunny had a link attached to it, leading to an aesthetic board relative to that bunny's 'personality'. I love aesthetic boards, they're so... Organized. So, in short, I used HTML to combine several of my favorite things. And to think, it all began with some Screaming.
